  <em>A self-contained, offline-first desktop file converter for text, audio, video, image, and 3D model formats.</em>
</p>

## What it does

Vitriol converts files between formats across five categories — **text, images, audio, video, and 3D models** — about 60 input formats and 50 output formats covered.

It also includes a feature called **Philosopher's Stone**: drop any lossless file in, get back an output that looks like an ordinary image, audio file, video, archive, or self-extracting script — but contains the original bytes inside, recoverable byte-exact through Vitriol. Optional password protection (AES-256). Optional Verify Round-Trip safety check that refuses to commit an output unless the reverse conversion produces the original.

### Format support

- **Text** — txt, md, html, json, xml, yaml, ini, log, csv, tsv, xlsx, docx, pdf, epub, rtf, pptx, odt
- **Images** — png, jpg, webp, bmp, tiff, gif, ico, tga, ppm/pgm/pbm, dds, heic, svg
- **Audio** — mp3, wav, flac, ogg, opus, m4a, aac, wma, aiff, alac, ac3, amr, au, mka
- **Video** — mp4, mkv, webm, avi, mov, wmv, flv, mpg, 3gp, ts, vob, ogv
- **3D models** — glb, gltf, obj, stl, fbx, ply, dae, 3ds

## Install & run

---

### From Clone:

_**(Requires Python installed)**_<br>

1. Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kl3mta3/Vitriol.git
```

2. Run
   
```
Vitriol.exe 
```
or 
```
Launcher.py
```

That's the entire setup. On first launch the launcher installs four Python packages (`PySide6`, `Pillow`, `striprtf`, `cryptography`), downloads FFmpeg + Assimp + bundled fonts to local folders, probes for hardware video encoders, and hands off to the main app. Subsequent launches are instant.

---

### From Zip:
_**(NO Python install required)**_<br>

1. Download Vitriol 1.1.0 — Portable Edition.zip here:( [Vitriol 1.1.0 — Portable Edition](https://github.com/kl3mta3/Vitriol/releases/download/Vitriol_1.1.0_Portable_Edition/Vitriol.1.1.0.Portable.Edition.zip)).
2. Unzip Vitriol 1.1.0 — Portable Edition.zip
3. Run
   
```
Vitriol.exe
```
That's the entire setup. Everything is bundled already!

---

### Fron Installer:
_**(NO Python install required)**_ <br>

1. Download VitriolSetup-1.1.0.exe here:( [VitriolSetup-1.1.0.exe](https://github.com/kl3mta3/Vitriol/releases/download/VitriolSetup_1.1.0_Windows/VitriolSetup-1.1.0.exe)).
2. Run
   
```
VitriolSetup-1.1.0.exe
```

That's the entire setup. Everything is bundled already!

---

When packaged as the installer (`VitriolSetup-x.y.z.exe` from `tools/build_installer.py`), end users don't need Python at all — everything is bundled.

## Philosopher's Stone

Philosopher's Stone mode enables going above and behyond _**Typical Conversion**_ 
allowing the conversion of one media type to another, 
hiding the source file inside one of several host formats. The output is a real, 
working file of its host type — opens in the appropriate viewer, 
plays in the appropriate player. Vitriol can recover the original bytes
from the host file byte-for-byte at any time, so important data can travel disguised as ordinary media.

Unlike most steganography tools, Vitriol does **not** require a user-supplied
carrier file. For cross-category conversions, the carrier is generated
deterministically from the source — when the output is an image of a fractal
or an audio file of generated music, that fractal or music IS Vitriol's
output, with the source data woven into its lowest bits. For same-category
conversions, the source itself serves as the carrier.

Optional **AES-256 password protection** encrypts the embedded payload — without
the password, recovery of the original bytes is computationally infeasible
even with Vitriol in hand. (See Below)

---

<div align="center">
  
## 
**Steganalysis caveat: Vitriol's embedding is not designed to defeat
adversarial deep-learning steganalyzers.**

**Casual file-content inspection,
statistical noise comparison, and standard "does this image look like a
fractal?" sanity checks will not surface the payload, but a determined
analyst running modern CNN-based detectors tuned to LSB-class embeddings
may be able to flag that hidden data is present (though not recover it
without the password). Treat Vitriol as plausible-deniability against
casual inspection plus strong cryptographic protection of the contents,
not as forensic-grade undetectability.**

## Available Formats

| Host format | What you get |
|---|---|
| `.png`, `.bmp` | An image. Same-category sources produce a passthrough image; cross-category sources produce a deterministic colored fractal. |
| `.wav`, `.aiff`, `.flac`, `.m4a` | An audio file. Same-category sources are normal audio; cross-category sources sound like generated music. |
| `.mkv` | A video file. Plays in any video player. Requires FFmpeg. |
| `.txt` | A text file with base64-style content. |
| `.py` | A self-extracting Python script. Run `python file.py` and it reconstructs the original. |
| `.exe` | A self-extracting Windows executable. End users don't need Python. |
| `.zip` | A standard ZIP archive containing the original file. Opens in any unzip tool. |
| `.ply`, `.obj`, `.glb` | A 3D model file. Opens in Blender, MeshLab, or any glTF viewer. |

</div>

Lossy formats (jpg, mp3, mp4, etc.) cannot be Stone sources — only lossless data round-trips meaningfully. `.zip` and `.exe` sources auto-engage Stone (they have no other purpose in Vitriol). Vitriol refuses `.py` ↔ `.py`, `.py` ↔ `.exe`, and `.exe` ↔ `.exe` conversions to prevent the tool from being used as a malware wrapper.


<br></br>

### Password protection

Each row in the playlist has an optional password (🔓 / 🔒 lock icon next to the save path). When set, the embedded payload is encrypted with **AES-256-CTR** under a key derived from your password via **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**. Without the right password, the file does not decode.

Wrong-password behavior depends on the host type. Two distinct designs for two threat models:

- **Image, audio, video, 3D, text, zip outputs** — wrong password produces silent garbage. There is no error message; the file gives no signal that encryption was used at all. Same-format outputs look identical whether they're password-protected or not. This preserves a *no-oracle* property: someone probing files cannot tell "right password produced wrong file" from "wrong password produced garbage."
- **Self-extracting `.py` and `.exe`** — these are interactive, so they print `Wrong password. X/5 attempts used.` After 5 wrong attempts the file invalidates itself and self-deletes.

**Forgetting a password means the file is unrecoverable.** Vitriol never stores, logs, or persists passwords. They live in the playlist row's memory and are gone the moment you remove the row or close the app.

### Verify Round-Trip

Optional safety toggle in the top bar. With it on, every Stone conversion immediately runs in reverse into a temp folder, and the output is only committed if the reverse produces bytes matching the original input. If they don't match, the output is discarded and the row is marked failed. Catches end-to-end integrity issues before they reach disk.

<br></br>

### Samples

The [`samples/`](samples) folder ships with three source files and the Stone outputs Vitriol produces from them, so you can see/hear/run the round-trip without installing anything. Drop any output back into Vitriol to recover the original.

Each output is a real working file of its host type — the `.png` opens in any image viewer, the `.wav` plays in any audio player, the `.mkv` plays in any video player, the `.py` runs with `python file.py`, and the `.exe` runs by double-click on Windows.

### Layering

Stone conversions can be chained for additional depth. Save a file as a `.png`, drop the `.png` back in and save it as a `.wav`, then the `.wav` as an `.mkv`, and so on. Each layer can carry its own password — recovering the original means unwrapping every layer in reverse order with the right password at each step. Forgetting any one password breaks the chain. Used sparingly this is a heavy increase in protection at the cost of file size and recovery effort.

## Markdown bundles (rich-format conversions)

When converting docx / pdf / epub / pptx → md, the markdown writer detects embedded images and produces a folder-structured output:

```
desired_output_location/
   my_document/
       my_document.md
       images/
           image1.png
           image2.jpg
```

The `.md` references images by relative paths (`![alt](images/image1.png)`). Pure-text conversions still produce a flat `.md`. The reverse direction (md → docx) reads this structure if present and re-embeds the images.

## Scope notes / known limits

- **Read-only formats:** PPTX, ODT, SVG, RTF write (RTF read works via striprtf).
- **PDF write** supports headings, paragraphs, lists, basic tables, and image placeholders. Bundled DejaVu Sans gives Latin Extended + Cyrillic + Greek coverage.
- **PDF read** handles uncompressed and FlateDecode streams. Encrypted PDFs and image-only (scanned, non-OCR) PDFs are not supported.
- **3D conversions** preserve geometry by default. When the source has animation/rig data AND the target format can carry it (`.fbx`, `.dae`, `.glb`, `.gltf`), Vitriol asks once — Yes attempts to preserve animations through the export (best-effort; outcome depends on the format pair), No strips them cleanly for predictable static-geometry output. Targets that can't carry animations by spec (`.obj`, `.stl`, `.ply`, `.3ds`) skip the prompt and always export geometry only.
- **3D animation export caveats:** Static models convert cleanly between every supported 3D format pair — geometry, materials, and textures preserve correctly in all directions. The caveats apply only to skinned + animated models:
  - **`.glb → .fbx` produces a structurally complete FBX** with mesh, materials, textures, skeleton, and animation curves all present — but the bind-pose link between mesh and skeleton is dropped (Assimp's FBX exporter doesn't emit the `BindPose` / `PoseNode` chunks for glTF input). The animation plays in any FBX viewer, but the mesh stays in its T-pose while the skeleton animates separately. Useful as an FBX export for static use; not useful for animated playback without further work.
  - **`.dae → .fbx` is fine for DAEs from other tools** (Blender, Maya, 3ds Max). It only fails for DAEs that Vitriol itself generated from an animated FBX or GLB — Assimp's DAE importer can't re-read the `$AssimpFbx$`-escaped node names that its own FBX importer creates and the DAE exporter writes. So if a user hands you a DAE from Blender, Vitriol → FBX works. Vitriol → DAE → Vitriol → FBX doesn't.
  - **`.fbx → .glb` (the Sketchfab path), `.fbx → .dae`, and `.glb → .dae` work for typical rigged characters** like Mixamo dances. They preserve skeleton, skin weights, and animation channels well enough that the result plays back correctly in standard viewers.
  - **Edge cases that can still lose data even on the working paths:** blendshape / morph-target rigs (facial animation), models with multiple FBX "Take" stacks, scenes with multiple skinned meshes sharing a skeleton, materials using newer glTF extensions like `KHR_materials_specular` when bridging through Collada. Bone-roll axis conventions differ between FBX and glTF and can shift subtly through a round-trip — the data is preserved but the visual result may drift a few degrees per joint in strict importers.
  - **Workaround for getting an animated character into FBX:** convert to `.dae` in Vitriol, then open the resulting `.dae` plus its sibling texture PNGs in Blender (`File → Open` → select the .dae) and export FBX from there. Blender's FBX exporter writes the bind-pose chunks Assimp's doesn't.
  - The animation-preservation prompt inside Vitriol flags the specific lossy `→ .fbx` case at conversion time so the user isn't surprised mid-batch.
